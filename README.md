# ðŸ’§ Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether water is safe for drinking based on various physicochemical properties using machine learning.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

Includes 10 features such as pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, etc.  
Target variable: `Potability`.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder and run:
   - `EDA.ipynb` for analysis
   - `Model_Training.ipynb` for model training
3. To train from script, run:
